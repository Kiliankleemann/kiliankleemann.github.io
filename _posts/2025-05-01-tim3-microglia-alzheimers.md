Alzheimer’s disease research is increasingly recognizing the central role of **microglia**, the brain’s resident immune cells, in shaping disease progression. In our recent *Nature* publication, we investigated how the immune checkpoint molecule **TIM-3 (HAVCR2)** regulates microglial function and constrains their ability to combat amyloid pathology.  

A major conceptual insight from this study is that **blocking TIM-3 releases microglia from a homeostatic state**, enabling them to enter a **neuroprotective, plaque-clearing phenotype** that slows Alzheimer’s pathology.

I contributed to the **single-cell RNA-seq**, **bulk RNA-seq processing**, and **transcriptomic analysis** that uncovered the gene-expression programs underlying this shift.

## TIM-3 as a Microglial Checkpoint  
TIM-3 is well known for driving T-cell exhaustion, but its function in microglia has been poorly understood. Using biochemical and transcriptomic analyses  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, we show that:

- **TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression** in microglia.  
- TIM-3 binds **TGFBR2** and **SMAD2**, enhancing SMAD2 phosphorylation.  
- This interaction **stabilizes a homeostatic microglial identity**.

When TIM-3 is present, microglia remain in a restrained state, limiting their ability to respond to pathological cues such as amyloid-β (Aβ).

## Releasing Microglia from Homeostasis Improves Alzheimer’s Pathology  
When **Havcr2 (TIM-3)** is selectively deleted in microglia:

- Microglia shift into a **MGnD/DAM-like activation state** with increased phagocytic gene expression  
- Pro-inflammatory signalling programs (TNF, IFNα, cGAS–STING) are **decoupled** from phagocytosis  
- **Amyloid plaque burden decreases significantly**  
- **Cognitive performance improves** in 5×FAD Alzheimer’s mouse models  
  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This demonstrates that TIM-3 acts as a **molecular brake** preventing microglia from entering a protective activation state. Its removal unleashes microglia to engage plaques more effectively and mitigate neurodegeneration.

Importantly, TIM-3 expression is elevated in **APOE4 carriers**, particularly women, correlating with impaired MGnD activation—suggesting strong translational relevance.

## Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals the Mechanism  
Using **single-nucleus RNA-seq**, **single-cell RNA-seq**, and **bulk RNA-seq**, we profiled how TIM-3 blockade remodels microglial states  
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:

- **Phagosome and lysosomal pathways** were upregulated across microglial clusters  
- Neuroprotective signalling (**PI3K–AKT–mTOR**) increased  
- **Homeostatic marker genes** like *P2ry12*, *Csf1r*, and *Siglech* were downregulated  
- **MGnD gene signatures** were strongly enhanced  
- Hypoxia signatures—associated with dysfunctional AD microglia—were reduced  

These multi-omics findings support a model in which TIM-3 normally maintains homeostasis via TGFβ signalling. Removing TIM-3 **releases microglia into a protective, anti-inflammatory, pro-phagocytic state** that is unusually effective at controlling plaque accumulation.

**My role:** I contributed to the computational analysis of both **single-cell** and **bulk transcriptomic datasets**, including quality control, differential gene expression, cluster-level scoring, and visualization of microglial state transitions.

## Therapeutic Implications  
Because **HAVCR2 is expressed specifically in microglia within the CNS**, targeting TIM-3 may allow:

- selective microglial reprogramming  
- enhanced plaque clearance  
- reduced inflammatory toxicity  
- minimal systemic immune side effects  

This positions TIM-3 as an attractive therapeutic target—especially for patient subgroups with impaired microglial activation, such as **APOE4 carriers**.
