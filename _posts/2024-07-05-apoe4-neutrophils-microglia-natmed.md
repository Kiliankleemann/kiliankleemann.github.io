I am excited to share a deeper look into my **shared first-author** publication in *Nature Medicine*, a project that grew out of my **Master’s thesis** and went on to become one of the cornerstone studies of my early research career. In this work, we investigated how the Alzheimer’s disease risk gene **APOE4** drives dysregulated communication between **neutrophils** and **microglia**, ultimately contributing to cognitive decline.

My contributions included **all computational data analysis**, spanning bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, machine-learning modeling, biomarker discovery, and transcriptomic integration. I also **wrote large portions of the manuscript**, and **designed, organized, and produced the figures** that present the central concepts of the study.

## Background: APOE4 as an Immune Risk Gene

APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. While traditionally viewed through the lens of lipid metabolism and amyloid biology, increasing evidence suggests that **APOE4 reshapes immune function**, both in the central nervous system and the periphery.

Our study reveals that APOE4 disrupts immune homeostasis by altering the behaviour of **neutrophils**, which in turn affects microglial activation states in the brain. According to the model and schematics in the paper *(see illustrated immune cascade on pg. 2 of the PDF)*, APOE4 drives a heightened innate immune tone that primes microglia toward dysfunctional activation during AD progression.

## A Machine-Learning Discovery: IL18R1+ Neutrophils as a Biomarker  
*(derived from transcriptomics and ML classification — see heatmap and feature-selection analysis on pg. 7)*

A central part of my master’s thesis was the application of **machine learning** to peripheral immune data to discover cell populations and molecular signatures associated with APOE4.

Using:

- feature selection methods  
- classification algorithms  
- transcriptomic integration across datasets  
- dimensionality reduction and clustering  
- pathway enrichment  

I identified a subset of **IL18R1-positive neutrophils** that were **pronounced in APOE4 carriers**, especially in women, mirroring the sex- and genotype-specific patterns seen in microglial dysfunction.

These IL18R1+ neutrophils displayed:

- pro-inflammatory signatures  
- altered chemokine receptor landscapes  
- associations with cognitive impairment scores  
- transcriptional alignment with disease-associated microglia (DAM/MGnD signatures)

This finding is highlighted as a **potential peripheral biomarker**, offering a window into CNS immune dysfunction through accessible blood measurements.

## Microglia Reflect Neutrophil Dysregulation  
*(see microglial single-cell UMAP and pathway overlays on pg. 4)*

Our analysis revealed that APOE4 disrupts not only peripheral immunity but also central microglial states. The transcriptomic maps show:

- increased **IFN-response microglia (IRM/IEM)**  
- dysregulated lipid metabolism  
- impaired transition into beneficial phagocytic states  
- elevated inflammatory tone in women carrying APOE4  

This immune axis — from blood neutrophils to brain microglia — underscores a multi-system nature of AD risk.

## What Makes IL18R1+ Neutrophils a Promising Biomarker?

From the combined machine-learning and RNA-seq analyses:

- **IL18R1 expression robustly discriminated APOE4 carriers**
- It correlated with microglial activation states in brain tissue  
- It was detectable in peripheral blood, making clinical translation feasible  
- It captured sex-dependent immune variation, which may refine risk stratification  

This discovery offers a novel bridge between **peripheral diagnostics** and **central immune pathology** in Alzheimer’s disease.

## My Contributions to the Study

This project was deeply meaningful to me, both scientifically and personally. My key contributions included:

- **Shared first authorship**  
- **Full computational analysis**, including:
  - bulk RNA-seq  
  - single-cell RNA-seq  
  - clustering, DEG analysis, pathway analysis  
  - machine learning for biomarker discovery  
  - integration of neutrophil and microglial datasets  
- **Conceptual development and model building**  
- **Manuscript writing**, including drafting several key sections  
- **Designing and producing the figures**, including the multi-layered immune interaction diagrams  
- **Data interpretation**, helping shape the narrative that connects APOE4, neutrophils, and microglia  

This publication played a formative role in shaping the direction of my PhD work on neuroimmune regulation and transposable element biology.

## A Step Toward Immune-Based Precision Medicine in Alzheimer’s

By identifying a **sex- and genotype-specific immune signature** and mapping its influence from the periphery to the brain, this study opens the door toward future:

- blood-based biomarkers  
- stratified clinical trials  
- targeted immunomodulatory therapies  

Our findings highlight that Alzheimer’s disease is not only a disorder of neurons and protein aggregates but also of **immune communication**—and that intervening in these pathways may offer entirely new treatment strategies.
