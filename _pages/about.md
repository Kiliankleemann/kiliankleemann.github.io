Welcome to my research portfolio. I am a PhD candidate in bioinformatics at the University of Bonn, where I study how the immune system responds to aging and Alzheimer’s disease. My work focuses on transposable elements (pieces of DNA that can move within the genome) and how they may activate immune pathways involved in neurodegeneration. To investigate these questions, I analyze large-scale biological datasets, including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, as well as other genomic profiling methods.

My path into research began during my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Glasgow, including reserach experience at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). I later conducted research in Boston at Brigham and Women’s Hospital / Harvard Medical School, where I worked in the field of neuroimmunology and strengthened my computational skills. I simoultanously completed a Master’s degree (remote) at the University of Portsmouth in data analytics before starting my doctoral studies.

A key part of my PhD involves a collaboration with Tongji University in Shanghai. I worked three months in 2024 and 2025 on joint projects on microglia, mitochondrial biology, and immune mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease. This international collaboration has become an important component of my research, connecting computational work with experimental neuroimmunology.
